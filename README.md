# Full Image Evaluation for Hand Posture Detection.


We put the ground truth and some tools  to perform the Full Image
Evaluation, using in  The National University of Singapore (NUS) Hand Posture Dataset
II  http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elepv/NUS-HandSet/ (NUS-database II). 
 

The proposed ground truth was used in the article "Real-Time Hand Posture Recognition
for Human-Robot Interaction Tasks" http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/36.
