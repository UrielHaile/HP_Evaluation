# Full Image Evaluation for Hand Posture Detection.

In this repository we put the ground truth and some tools  to perform the Full Image Evaluation, using the NUS-II dataset. The proposed ground truth was used in the article "Real-Time Hand Posture Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction Tasks" http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/36.
