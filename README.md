# Full Image Evaluation for Hand Posture Detection.

In this repository we put the ground truth and some tools  to perform the Full Image Evaluation, using in  The National University of Singapore (NUS) Hand Posture Dataset II  http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elepv/NUS-HandSet/.

The proposed ground truth was used in the article "Real-Time Hand Posture Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction Tasks" http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/36.
